# Hand-Gesture-Video-Player

A Hand-Gesture Video Player allows users to control playback using hand gestures via computer vision. It uses OpenCV for video processing, MediaPipe for hand tracking, NumPy for calculations, PyAutoGUI for simulating controls, and cvzone for integration. This touchless system enhances accessibility and user experience.

Hand Detection:   
The figure below shows the hand detection using AI hand gesture. 

To read the image or video frames, the implementation is to load 

the OpenCV library using the PyCharm IDE or the command line.
